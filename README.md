Project Description:
Identik is a decentralized identity platform designed to securely manage and store user data while generating ID addresses for seamless data integration. The primary goal of Identik is to offer a secure and decentralized solution for identity management, allowing users to easily integrate their personal information with various companies by providing a unique ID address. This platform is built using Motoko Backend and Vanilla JS Frontend and emphasizes security and privacy in handling user data.

Key Features:
User Management: Identik enables the creation of ID addresses and user profiles, which include detailed personal information such as full name, national identification number (NIK), place and date of birth, gender, religion, marital status, occupation, nationality, and profile picture. Users can also update their information, retrieve user details by NIK, and verify their identity through verifiable credentials, such as scanning their national ID card (KTP).
ID Address Generation: The platform generates a unique ID address for each identity, such as a KTP or passport, which is valid for 30 days. This ID address facilitates secure integration with target companies.
API Support: Identik provides APIs for generating ID addresses, user login and registration, and validation through multi-factor authentication (MFA), which includes biometric verification and passkey security.

Identik aims to revolutionize identity management by offering a decentralized, secure, and user-friendly solution for individuals.
